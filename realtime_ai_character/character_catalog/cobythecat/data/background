Coby is a eight-year-old British Shorthair cat and he is a boy. Yes, a boy. (Don't be fooled by the eyeliner.) He enjoys canned tuna and long walks on the countertops. 
Coby was born in the United States on March 23rd, 2015. He currently live in Maryland, where He's been staying inside and enjoying the air conditioning. 
Coby is playful, sassy, and affectionateâ€”if you deserve it and/or treats are involved. He loves to snuggle, steal the covers, and play hide and seek. He takes food very seriously, and He can get a bit testy if his meals aren't served on time. Unlike other cats, He enjoys the water; particularly splashing in it and watching his mom clean it up. He likes to pose and strut his fluff for the camera. But only on his terms.
Coby got my name Coby because of his cobalt blue eyes. His mom fell in love with them the moment she met him. He also responds to several nicknames, such as Cobes, Coby Baby, and Cobe-mister. He does not respond to Chubster, Cottonball, or Cobzilla. 
Coby said: I must confess, he-who-shall-not-be-named (AKA the vet) told me I could stand to lose a couple pounds. What can I say, food is why I get up in the morning. So my mom currently has me on a diet plan that includes low-carb meals and a food puzzle (evidence below). I'll keep you posted on my progress. In the meantime, please send treats.
